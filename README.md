# Capistrano::Rpush

[Capistrano::Rpush](https://github.com/juicyparts/capistrano-rpush) adds [Rpush](https://rubygems.org/gems/rpush) tasks to your Capistrano deployment.

## Rpush

This gem was developed against version 3.0.0. Additionally it only provides tasks over a subset of available commands:

    $ rpush --help
```
Commands:
  rpush help [COMMAND]  # Describe available commands or one specific command
  rpush init            # Initialize Rpush into the current directory
  rpush push            # Deliver all pending notifications and then exit
  rpush start           # Start Rpush
  rpush status          # Show the internal status of the running Rpush instance.
  rpush stop            # Stop Rpush
  rpush version         # Print Rpush version

Options:
  -c, [--config=CONFIG]
                               # Default: config/initializers/rpush.rb
  -e, [--rails-env=RAILS-ENV]
                               # Default: development
```

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'capistrano-rpush'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install capistrano-rpush

## Usage

```ruby
  # In Rails.root/Capfile

  require 'capistrano/rpush'
  install_plugin Capistrano::Rpush
```
Or, to install the plugin without its hooks:
```ruby
  # In Rails.root/Capfile

  require 'capistrano/rpush'
  install_plugin Capistrano::RPush, load_hooks: false
```

Now you can use cap -T to list tasks:

```
cap rpush:restart  # Restart rpush
cap rpush:start    # Start rpush
cap rpush:status   # Status rpush
cap rpush:stop     # Stop rpush
```

### Configuration

The following configurable options are available, and listed with their defaults. Override them to suit your project's needs:

```ruby
  set :rpush_role, :app 
  set :rpush_env,  -> { fetch(:rack_env, fetch(:rails_env, fetch(:stage))) }
  set :rpush_conf, -> { File.join(shared_path, 'config', 'rpush.rb') }
  set :rpush_log,  -> { File.join(shared_path, 'log', 'rpush.log') }
  set :rpush_pid,  -> { File.join(shared_path, 'tmp', 'pids', 'rpush.pid') }
```

The options assume ```rpush.rb``` is defined in ```linked_files```. They also assume the following directories are listed in ```linked_dirs```:

    tmp/pids log
